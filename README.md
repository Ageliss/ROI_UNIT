# ROI Constraint UNIT
[Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation Networks (UNIT)](https://github.com/mingyuliutw/UNIT) proposed by NVIDIA presented a general framework for unsupervised image-to-image translation. This network can learn to translate an image from one domain to another without any image pairs information between the two domains. In this report, I basically add region of interest (ROI) constraint to UNIT to enhance the ability of transferring images between summer and winter on a specific dataset "Cab Ride Norway : Trondheim - Bod√∏ Nordland Line"([summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY1sbKvjNcY&t=1057s), [winter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pVWfzsgLoQ&t=8081s)). The experiment results show an improvement both on the training speed and the image translation quality between summer and winter railway trip.

## Organization of Codes
- The original UNIT
    - `datasets`
        Directory for different kinds of image loaders, defined in the original UNIT
    - `tools`
        Directory for training configuration loading, defined in the original UNIT
    - `trainers`
        Directory for the implementation of different netwokrs, generators, discriminators and encoders
    - `cocogan_train_domain_adaptation.py`
        Training scirpt for implementing domain adaptation
    - `cocogan_translate_one_image.py`
        Inference script for translating one image to the other domain
    - `cocogan_translate.py`
        Inference script for translating all images from image loader to the other domain
    - `common.py`
        A helper script for training utilization 
- My improvement
    - `cocogan_train_roi.py`
        Training script of ROI (Region of Interest) Constraint UNIT. I basically add a ROI generator and discriminator to enforce cycle consistency to the cropped image domains.
    - `trainers/cocgan_trainer.py`
        A script for implementing the weight update operation of generators and discriminators. I modified the weight update function to adapt to our needs.
    - `run_same_image_for_iterations.py`
        A script to generate image translation results for multiple generators
    - `run_same_net_for_images.py`
        A script to generate multiple image translation results using a specific generator
